# Introduction

The primary objective of this notebook is to explore the tidymodels predictive model framework. I am familiar with the caret package but as Max Kuhn has replaced caret with tidymodels and it has been available for a couple of years, I thought it a good time to take it for a test ride. To enable me to explore the framework a churn [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling) provided by **Shurti_lyyer** on Kaggle will be used. The objective of this analysis is to complete a binary classification to identify whether a customer will leave the business.

From reading online, within the tidymodels framework the key packages are:

* rsample - Different types of re-samples
* recipes - Transformations for model data pre-processing
* parnip - A common interface for model creation
* tune - Framework for hyperparameter tuning
* dials - Specific hyperparameter tuning functions
* yardstick - Measure model performance

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```


# Data loading

To kick start this project, the fread function from the data.table package is used to load the data into memory.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load data
df_churn <- 
  data.table::fread("C:/Users/Anthony/Documents/Git/Project Portfolio/tidymodels_exploration/Churn_Modelling.csv")
```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

The skim function from the **skimr** package produces the summary output below, showing that we have `r comma(nrow(df_churn))` observations and `r ncol(df_churn)` variables. There are 3 character variables and 11 numeric.

The character variables relate to gender, geography and customer's surname. The numerical variables have two references of Id (rows and customer). Beyond this, data relates to age, tenure, credit, income and our final variable of whether the customer churned (labelled as Exited).

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Summarise datafrmae
skim(df_churn)
```

The skim output shows that most of the variable names have a mixture of upper and lower case characters. The set_names functions coverts all variable names to lower case. This makes the programming a little bit easier. Further to this there is a variable 'RowNumber' and 'customerid' which just references the row of each observation and a unique identifier for each customer. These can be removed from the analysis.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Convert all names to lower case
df_churn <-
  df_churn %>%
    set_names(., tolower(names(.))) %>%
    select(-c(rownumber, customerid))
```

## Exploring Target Variable

The target variable in this dataset is **exited**, the chart below shows that roughly 80% of customers remain while the remaining 20% of customers churn. This is a fairly unbalanced data, so we might have to treat that at another time. The target variable is stored as numeric, I will convert it to a factor with levels relating to remain and churn.

```{r echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

# Visualise the distribution of the data
df_churn %>%
  select(exited) %>%
  mutate(exited = factor(exited, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Remain", "Churn"))) %>%
  group_by(exited) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = exited, y = p)) +
    geom_col(fill = "blue") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
    ggtitle("Proportion of Loan Repayments & Default")

# Change the variable type from numeric to factor
df_churn <- 
  df_churn %>% 
    mutate(exited = factor(exited, levels = c(1,0), labels = c("Churn", "Remain")))


```

## Exploring Categorical Variables

The chart below indicates that male customers have a lower risk of churning that female customers. Looking at the Geography variable, there doesn't appear to be a difference between the underlying rates of churn for customers from France and Spain. However, comparing the both of those to Germany, they both have much lower likelihood of churn.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

# Land and structure based variables
grid.arrange(
             widths = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
             layout_matrix = 
                      rbind(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)),
             
          # Distribution by Geography
          df_churn %>%
            group_by(geography, exited) %>%
            count() %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = geography, y = n, fill = exited)) +
            geom_col(position = "fill") +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
            labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                  legend.position = "bottom") +
            ggtitle("Geography"),
          
          
          # Distribution by Gender
          df_churn %>%
            group_by(gender, exited) %>%
            count() %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = n, fill = exited)) +
            geom_col(position = "fill") +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
            labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                  legend.position = "bottom") +
            ggtitle("Gender")
            )
```

The final categorical variable is the customer's surname, of the 10,000 observations, there are just under 3,000 unique surnames. This indicates that some customers come from families (some quite large) who all have accounts with the same bank. The histogram indicates that the majority of the bank customers are the only one from their family that bank there. However, a number of customers do have multiple family members. There appears to be a relationship that the larger the family size who have an account the lower the churn rate. In the following section it could be good to explore additional ways of including the surname into the model.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Land and structure based variables
grid.arrange(
             widths = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
             layout_matrix = 
                      rbind(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)),

            # Unique surname
            df_churn %>%
              select(surname) %>%
              unique() %>%

              ggtitle("Churn Perc vs Total Occurance of Surname")
)

```

## Exploring Numerical Variables          

The plot looks at the relationship between each numeric variable and churn. Two of the variables 'hascrcard' and 'isactivemember' are binary variables and should be visualised in a different form. The remaining variables can be summarised as:

* Age: There appears to be a relationship that customers that churn are older on average than customers that don't
* Balance: The average balance of customers who churn and remain are similar. However, those who churn tend to have a higher balance
* Credit score: There doesn't appear to be much of a difference with regards to creditscore
* Estimated salary: Again there doesn't appear to be much of a difference with regard to salary
* Number of products: On average customers that remain have more than one product, while customers that leave have only one
* Tenure: There is a wider distribution of tenure within customers that churn, it appears that newer and older customers could have a higher likelihood of churning

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.height=12, fig.width=12}

# Relationship with Churn and Numerical variables
df_churn %>%
  {bind_cols(select_if(., is.numeric),
             select_at(., "exited"))
  } %>%
  gather(-exited, key = "var", value = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = exited, y = value, fill = exited)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    facet_wrap(~ var, scales = "free")  +
    ggtitle("Numerical Variable Relationship with Churn")

```

As mentioned above the 'credit card' and 'Active member' variables shouldn't be visualised using a boxplot. To generate the following plot, the variables are firstly converted to factors and then the plot explores whether there is a relationship with churn. Having a credit card doesn't appear to impact the customers likelihood to churn. Alternatively, whether the customer is considered active, definately has a relationship, 'Active' customers have much lower liklihood of churning.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

# Visualise models
grid.arrange(
             widths = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
             layout_matrix = 
                      rbind(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)),
             
          # Distribution by Credit Card
          df_churn %>%
            mutate(hascrcard = factor(hascrcard, labels = c("No Card", "Has Card"))) %>%
            group_by(hascrcard, exited) %>%
            count() %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = hascrcard, y = n, fill = exited)) +
            geom_col(position = "fill") +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
            labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                  legend.position = "bottom") +
            ggtitle("Credit Card"),
          
          
          # Distribution by isactivemember
          df_churn %>%
            mutate(isactivemember = factor(isactivemember, labels = c("Inactive", "Active"))) %>%
            group_by(isactivemember, exited) %>%
            count() %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = isactivemember, y = n, fill = exited)) +
            geom_col(position = "fill") +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
            labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                  legend.position = "bottom") +
            ggtitle("Active Member")
            )
```

The plot below indicates that the numerical predictors are not particularly correlated, so no actions are required to address multicollinariety.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create a variable of total family size
corrplot(cor(df_churn %>% select_if(is.numeric)))

```

# Feature Engineering

An important part of the model building process is to try and create new predictors which will improve the accuracy of the model. The information gained from the exploratory analysis, provides a couple of ideas as to which variables can be generated.

### Surname

Given that the surname has circa 3k unique entries, it is unlikely that the variable will be entered into the model. Instead some of the information embedded will be used to generate new variables. The first variable which will be created is a count of the total number of family members with the same surname. As seen in the section above this appeared to show a negatively correlated relationship.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create a variable of total family size
df_churn <-
  df_churn %>%
  left_join(df_churn %>%
              group_by(surname, exited) %>%
              count() %>%
              spread(exited, n) %>%
              replace_na(list(Churn = 0, Remain = 0)) %>%
              mutate(total_family = Churn + Remain) %>%
              select(surname, total_family),
            by = "surname")

```

Without commiting to thorough text analytics, there might be some value in seeing if the attributes of a customer's name has a relationship with whether they churn. A simple approach is taken here, firstly 26 new columns are created to capture each letter of the alphabet a:z. Then for each surname those columns are populated with the counts of times the letter appeared in the customer's name. The final step is to try and reduce the new 26 columns down, a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to achieve this. The output below shows that the first 10 principle components represent 75% of the variation in the letters associated with customer's names.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Create a df with 26 columns
df_alphabet <-  
  cbind(
        df_churn %>%
          select(surname),
        matrix(0, nrow = nrow(df_churn), ncol = 26) %>%
        as.data.frame() %>%
        set_names(., c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", 
                       "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", 
                       "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", 
                       "y", "z"))
        )

# Fill df with counts of letters in customer's name
df_alphabet[2:ncol(df_alphabet)] <-
  sapply(names(df_alphabet[2:ncol(df_alphabet)]), function(x) {str_count(df_alphabet[,1], x)})
  

# Create PCA analysis and plot
pca <- prcomp(df_alphabet[2:ncol(df_alphabet)])
summary(pca) 

```

The plot below shows the distribution of churn and remain for the first 10 principle components just created. There doesn't appear to be much variation based on the name based components, however this will be explored more rigourously during feature selection.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Visualise relationship with churn
cbind(df_churn %>% select(exited), pca$x[,1:10]) %>%
  gather(-exited, key = "var", value = "value") %>%
  mutate(var = as.numeric(substr(var, 3,4))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = exited, y = value, fill = exited)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_grid(. ~ var) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
          legend.position = "none",
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    ggtitle("Surname PCA and Churn/ Remain")


# Update churn dataframe
df_churn <-
  cbind(df_churn,
        pca$x[,1:10]) %>%
  rename_at(vars(starts_with('PC')), funs(paste0('Name', .)))

rm(df_alphabet, pca) # reduce memory size

```

#### Tenure

The exploratory analysis revealed that the distribution of tenure for customers who left the bank was a lot wider than those who remained. It suggested that maybe newer and longer standing customers were at higher risk of churn, while medium term customers had a lower likelihood. As such a new variable will be created which splits tenure into less than 3 being a new cusotmer and being longer than 7 being older customer.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create a variable
df_churn <-
  df_churn %>%
    mutate(tenure_fct = factor(case_when(tenure <= 3 ~ "New",
