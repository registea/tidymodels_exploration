# Introduction

The primary objective of this notebook is to explore the tidymodels predictive model framework. I am familiar with the caret package but as Max Kuhn has replaced caret with tidymodels and it has been available for a couple of years, I thought it a good time to take it for a test ride. To enable me to explore the framework a churn [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling) provided by **Shurti_lyyer** on Kaggle will be used. The objective of this analysis is to complete a binary classification to identify whether a customer will leave the business.

From reading online, within the tidymodels framework the key packages are:

* rsample - Different types of re-samples
* recipes - Transformations for model data pre-processing
* parnip - A common interface for model creation
* tune - Framework for hyperparameter tuning
* dials - Specific hyperparameter tuning functions
* yardstick - Measure model performance

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Data loading

To kick start this project, the fread function from the data.table package is used to load the data into memory.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load data
df_churn <- 
  data.table::fread("C:/Users/Anthony/Documents/Git/Project Portfolio/tidymodels_exploration/Churn_Modelling.csv")
```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

The skim function from the **skimr** package produces the summary output below, showing that we have `r comma(nrow(df_churn))` observations and `r ncol(df_churn)` variables. There are 3 character variables and 11 numeric.

The character variables relate to gender, geography and customer's surname. The numerical variables have two references of Id (rows and customer). Beyond this, data relates to age, tenure, credit, income and our final variable of whether the customer churned (labelled as Exited).

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Summarise datafrmae
skim(df_churn)
```

The skim output shows that most of the variable names have a mixture of upper and lower case characters. The set_names functions coverts all variable names to lower case. This makes the programming a little bit easier. Further to this there is a variable 'RowNumber' and 'customerid' which just references the row of each observation and a unique identifier for each customer. These can be removed from the analysis.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Convert all names to lower case
df_churn <-
  df_churn %>%
    set_names(., tolower(names(.))) %>%
    select(-c(rownumber, customerid))
```

## Exploring Target Variable

The target variable in this dataset is **exited**, the chart below shows that roughly 80% of customers remain while the remaining 20% of customers churn. This is a fairly unbalanced data, so we might have to treat that at another time. The target variable is stored as numeric, I will convert it to a factor with levels relating to remain and churn.

```{r echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

# Visualise the distribution of the data
df_churn %>%
  select(exited) %>%
  mutate(exited = factor(exited, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Remain", "Churn"))) %>%
  group_by(exited) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = exited, y = p)) +
    geom_col(fill = "blue") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
    ggtitle("Proportion of Loan Repayments & Default")

# Change the variable type from numeric to factor
df_churn <- 
  df_churn %>% 
    mutate(exited = factor(exited, levels = c(1,0), labels = c("Churn", "Remain")))


```

## Exploring Categorical Variables

The chart below indicates that male customers have a lower risk of churning that female customers. Looking at the Geography variable, there doesn't appear to be a difference between the underlying rates of churn for customers from France and Spain. However, comparing the both of those to Germany, they both have much lower likelihood of churn.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

# Land and structure based variables
grid.arrange(
             widths = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
             layout_matrix = 
                      rbind(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)),
             
          # Distribution by Geography
          df_churn %>%
            group_by(geography, exited) %>%
            count() %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = geography, y = n, fill = exited)) +
            geom_col(position = "fill") +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
            labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                  legend.position = "bottom") +
            ggtitle("Geography"),
          
          
          # Distribution by Gender
          df_churn %>%
            group_by(gender, exited) %>%
            count() %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = n, fill = exited)) +
            geom_col(position = "fill") +
            scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
            labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                  legend.position = "bottom") +
            ggtitle("Gender")
            )
```

The final categorical variable is the customer's surname, of the 10,000 observations, there are just under 3,000 unique surnames. This indicates that some customers come from families (some quite large) who all have accounts with the same bank. The histogram indicates that the majority of the bank customers are the only one from their family that bank there. However, a number of customers do have multiple family members. There appears to be a relationship that the larger the family size who have an account the lower the churn rate. In the following section it could be good to explore additional ways of including the surname into the model.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Land and structure based variables
grid.arrange(
             widths = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
             layout_matrix = 
                      rbind(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                            c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)),
